>Prerequisites: <br/>
>A mySql schema or database matching to the value in .env file <br/>
>
>Note: <br/>
>The app is in its basic version for demo and needs many upgrades. <br/>
>I did not include the email registration, verification and alert feature beacuse I generally use Stripe for email services and it requires a valid organization website and organization details for creating the account and using its services. Using alternatives like Gmail is possible, which I have used in other apps but not convenient
